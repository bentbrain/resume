    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      With a background in design and a love of technology, my goal is to bring
      beautiful and impactful designs to life on the web. My experience covers a
      broad range of creative practices including graphic design, motion
      graphics and photography – but nothing excites me more than combining all
      of these skills while designing for the web.

      I’ve had great responsibilities in my roles, including as a Retoucher,
      ensuring images were perfect before national publication for large
      Australian brands. As a Web Designer, I created a fresh and engaging Order
      Confirmation page for Australia’s largest online retailer.
